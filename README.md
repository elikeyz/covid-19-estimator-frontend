# COVID-19 Estimator

This is a simple application that enables you to estimate the projected impact of the COVID-19 virus in a community over a given period of time. It uses an estimation calculator built from data gathered over time about the spread of the virus.

This application was built as an assessment project for the Build For SDG Program organised by Andela and Facebook Developer Circles.
